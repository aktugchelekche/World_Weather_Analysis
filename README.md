# World Weather Analysis

## Overview of Project: 

In this project, I am going to create an app that will help to find best vacation place according to client needs. This simple app will help clients to filter by the Country they want to visitthen filter by weather preferences within the Country.

In order to create this app, I utilized Google Map and Places API as well as Open Weather Api. First, by using Open Weather Api, I created a database which includes Max Temperature, Country etc. of each city  within more than 500 cities. Then ask clients regarding their preferences. After receiving feedback as staying in US but making sure that the Temperature is stay between 45 F to 70 F. 
 
Lastly, I presented my finding and client decided to have road trip started from Portland, North Bend , Weiser then West Richland and back to Portland again. I decided to help them with generating a direction itinerary map and as well as a map with hotel information and weather expectation. 

## Summary 

1- This app brings weather forecast from 500+ cities.

2- Once a client enter her/his weather preference, It will filter down number of cities according to the preference then will generate a map with weather forecast for each cities. The client can click on each marker to see information regarding following:
* Hotel Name 
* City
* Country
* Current Weather Forecast
