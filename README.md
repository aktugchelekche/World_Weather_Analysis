# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview of Project: 

In this project, I am going to assist Adriana with finding best vacation place according to her needs. This simple app will help her to filter by the Country she wants to visit in  then filter by weather preferences within the Country.

In order to create this app, I utilized Google Map and Places API as well as Open Weather Api. First, by using Open Weather Api, I created a database which includes Max Temperature, Country etc. of each city  within more than 500 cities. Then took this database and ask Adriana regarding her preferences. She stated that she wanted to stay in US but making sure that the Temperature is stay between 45 F to 70 F. 

After receiving feedback from her, I have narrowed down the database and created new database with 128 hotel different which in US. 

Lastly, I presented my finding and she decided to have road trip started from Portland, North Bend , Weiser then West Richland and back to Portland again. I decided to help her with generating a direction itinerary map and as well as a map with hotel information and weather expectation. 

## Summary 

1- This app contain weather information from 500+ cities 

2- Once a client enter her/his weather preference, It will filter down number of cities according to the preference then will generate a map with weather forecast for each cities. The client can click on each marker to see information regarding following:
*Hotel Name 
*City
*Country
*Current Weather Forecast 

3- After deciding visiting cities and country, it will generate a map with direction between the cities.



4-Then lastly it will generate a map with hotel information and weather forecast for each city of visit.
